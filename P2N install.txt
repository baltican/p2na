Windows :
	1. Download Anaconda 3 (big installation, https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) OR Miniconda https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
	2. Install it and remember (%YOURPATH) the installation PATH eg. c:\Miniconda3 for instance. Prefer ANSi friendly pathnames (no accent, no windows destop, no space, etc.). 
2.5 	Launch Anaconda Prompt and "add this to path" if you find how to do it as it is proposed in the graphical interface of the installation
	3. Download P2N latest https://github.com/Patent2net/P2N-v3
		Unzip to a temporary directory
		go to the unzipped P2N directory and edit installP2N.bat to replace d:\Miniconda3 with YOUR current installation directory (from step 2) (c:\Miniconda3?)
	4. Launch (double click) installP2N.bat 
	(let it work; do not close windows; that process can be quite long depending on you machine and network access)
	5. copy or create cles-epo.txt file (be aware must be ANSI encode caracters!)
	6. formulate the desired *.cql fileS (yes you can have many) in ./REQUESTS/ directory
	7. double click runP2N.bat

note (October 2019): 
Since EPO-Client seems to be broken please use the forked version of epo-ops client (adapted from George Song one) in P2N. 
Follow this procedure AFTER step 4:
	a. Download the zip file https://github.com/Patent2net/python-epo-ops-client
	b. unzip to a folder
	c. launch "InstallForP2N.bat"
